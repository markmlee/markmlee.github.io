# personal website
This repo is for the website https://markmlee.github.io/

# updated website
This repo is built on a fork of **Jekyll Now** from [this repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now). **Jekyll** is a static site generator that's perfect for GitHub hosted blogs ([Jekyll Repository](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll))

The website design is just a modification of [Jon Barron's website](https://jonbarron.info/) and [Leonoid Keselmen's website](https://leonidk.com/).
