We present a multi-modal classification framework that fuses audio and visual data to identify which part of a tree: 
leaf, twig, trunk, or ambientâ€”a robot is in contact with. Multisensory data collected on human probe transfers zero-shot to different embodiment on the robot 
by leveraging audio pre-processing and pretraining.
