We present a new robotic butler system for a wheeled humanoid that is capable of fetching requested objects at 24% of the speed a human needs to fulfill the same task. We achieve this speedup by integrating a 3D object detection pipeline with a kinematically optimal manipulation planner to significantly increase speed performance at runtime.
